## Requirements
Installation of this requires a userscript manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

Tampermonkey is available for all major browsers including [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en). (Click the name of your browser to install the extension for your browser)

## Installation
After installing Tampermonkey (see above) or another userscript manager, get the script [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaxutic/TwitchModBadgeColours/master/ModBadges.user.js). (Most userscript managers should recognise the file as a userscript and open the installation page for you, otherwise you will have to manually add it into your manager)

Refresh Twitch after installation for the script to take effect.
